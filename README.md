# Datasets &amp; technology development of human wildlife conflict solutions.

The Arribada Initiative is actively working to develop in-field early warning systems utilising thermal technologies. This repository hosts the data, software and hardware designs for both our field research and prototype solutions.

We are currently focused on two species;

* Early warning / detection of elephants using microbolometer sensors & edge machine learning
* Early warning / detection of polar bears using microbolometer sensors & edge machine learning

# Detection of elephants
