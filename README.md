# Datasets &amp; technology development of human wildlife conflict solutions.

The Arribada Initiative is actively working to develop in-field early warning systems utilising thermal technologies. This repository hosts the data, software and hardware designs for both our field research and prototype solutions.

We are currently focused on two species;

* Early warning / detection of **elephants** using microbolometer sensors & edge machine learning
* Early warning / detection of **polar bears** using microbolometer sensors & edge machine learning

# Hackster.io / SmartParks ElephantEdge Competition

Arribada's thermal elephant data collection is open source (GPLv3) and available for use by anyone wishing to train their own models thermal / optical models for the **ElephantEdge** competition, hosted by Hackster.io and SmartParks. Arribada is also a partner of the [OpenCollar](https://opencollar.io) initiative and is delighted to support the development opportunity to incorporate an open camera system with inference on the edge.
